# course-management-system
A copy from a training project. A university course manager using basic OOP and Swing GUI 

## How to use
Login credentials are hardcoded for this exercise. Usernames are: 
Students: 
S1, S2, S3 .....
Profs:
P1, P2, P3 .....
Admin: 
A1

Password is "password" for all users

## Features

Students can browse for courses to add to their time table.
Professors can manage their course lectures and assign grades to students.
Admins can create new course codes and lecture instances.

## Java concepts learned
- Using OOP to manage the different users.
- Frequently using Lists, particularly arraylists, and tried different methods to make querying through lists of lectures easier. First use of List streams.
- Using Java Swing UI, particularly the gridbag layout. 
- Intuitive use of some separation of concerns, that resembles a rudimentary MVC concept. We later learned about proper MVC frameworks in the latter part of our training programme. 

## Summary
This was our first capstone and an adrenaline rush to complete within a week. We got to collaborate over git and create a functioning, practical app from scratch. There are a lot more features we can add, and we could revisit this project again now that we've gained a lot more experience.
